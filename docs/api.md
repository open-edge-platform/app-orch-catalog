# REST API

We use the [Buf](https://buf.build/) tool. to generate [REST API specification](../api/spec/openapi.yaml) leveraging several plugins to streamline the process. These plugins include go for Go code generation, go-grpc for gRPC services, kollalabs for OpenAPI v3 specifications, grpc-gateway for RESTful APIs, validate for schema validation, and doc for generating documentation. This setup ensures efficient and
consistent API development and documentation. The API design is guided by the architectural guidelines in the
[architecture](../docs/architecture.md)  document.

The implementation of mapping the API back to the gRPC implementation is realized through code
generated by the [grpc-gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) tool.
