# REST API

The REST API specification [api/spec/openapi.yaml] is generated from the Protobuf specifications in
* [api/catalog]

by the [proto-gen-openapi](https://github.com/google/gnostic/tree/main/cmd/protoc-gen-openapi) tool.

The API design is guided by the architectural guidelines in the 
[software-architecture-specs]

The implementation of mapping the API back to the gRPC implementation is realized through code
generated by the [grpc-gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) tool.
