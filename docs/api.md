# REST API
## API Location
The API design is guided by the architectural guidelines in the architecture document. 
The API is located under [REST API specification](../api/spec/openapi.yaml) 

## API Generation 
We use the Buf tool to generate the REST API specification leveraging several 
plugins to streamline the process. These plugins include go 
for Go code generation, go-grpc for gRPC services, kollalabs for OpenAPI v3 specifications, grpc-gateway for RESTful APIs, validate for schema validation, and doc for generating documentation. 


## API Implementation
The implementation of mapping the API back to the gRPC implementation is 
realized through code generated by the [grpc-gateway] tool. The protobuf definitions of the catalog API are located
under [Catalog Protobuf Spec].
The generated code is located in the [API Generated Code] directory.
The generated code includes the gRPC server and client code, as well as the generated code for the grpc-gateway. The grpc-gateway is responsible for converting the incoming HTTP requests into
gRPC requests and sending the responses back to the client.
