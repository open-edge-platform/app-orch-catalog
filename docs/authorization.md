# Authorization

Authorization is implemented as a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in a distributed
fashion in the Application Catalog by running [Open Policy Agent] as a sidecar to the `application-catalog`
container.

# Authentication

Authorization depends on the Application Catalog being configured with an Identity Provider to implement
the Authentication feature. Authentication is implemented as a gRPC interceptor that verifies the JWT token.
The implementation of the gRPC interceptor is in the [Authentication gRPC Interceptor] package.

## Coder Deployment

[Keycloak] is already configured in this environment.

## Cloud Deployment (app-configs)

[Keycloak] is already deployed through Fleet in the cloud deployment.

## Open Policy Agent (OPA)

A distributed [Open Policy Agent] is necessary since the Application Catalog is the ultimate source of truth about
its managed objects (such as Applications), and the interpretation of the meaning of each of the **roles** that a user
may possess ultimately happens in the Application Catalog.

Open Policy Agent runs as a sidecar and optionally exposes its API to the cluster (as a Service), so that auditing and
logging can be extracted from it on demand. If the Service is not enabled, the API is still available to the
`application-catalog` container through `localhost:8181`.

## OPA Triggers

OPA is called each time one of the gRPC methods from [service.proto](../api/catalog/v3/service.proto)
is invoked.

There are two broad categories:

- READ operations (GET or LIST) - the response will be a filtered set of whatâ€™s allowed.
- WRITE operations (CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE) - the response will be a Boolean true/false representing allowed or denied.

## Roles

Roles are defined dynamically by the Keycloak Tenant Manager as projects are created and deleted.
The relevant roles for the Application Catalog are:

- **cat-r** - Catalog Read-Only
- **cat-rw** - Catalog Read-Write
- **ao-m2m-rw** - Machine-to-Machine Read-Write

## Rules in the Context of the Application Catalog

The rules define the following relationship between the roles and the managed objects of the Catalog Application:

|           | Registry   | Artifact   | Application | Deployment<br/>Package |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| cat-rw    | **RW all** | **RW all** | **RW all**  | **RW all**             |
| cat-r     | RO all     | RO all     | RO all      | RO all                 |
| ao-m2m-rw | **RW all** | **RW all** | **RW all**  | **RW all**             |

## Calling OPA

OPA executes policy decisions using REGO rules applied to data sets.

The two major data sets are:

- `input` - provided in JSON format during a query, specifically:
  - `request` - the contents of the gRPC request being authorized.
  - `metadata` - the contents of the gRPC metadata, including the JWT token.
- `data` - provided in advance and cached in JSON format, containing the complete contents of the Application Catalog database.

All **Write** actions are checked for authorization by passing the `input` listed above to the OPA Sidecar at
a URL matching the Request type name, e.g., `CreateApplicationRequest`.
OPA performs the query on this rule and returns the result to the Application Catalog.

If the rule:

- evaluates to `{"result":true}`, access is granted.
- evaluates to any other response, e.g., `{}`, access is denied.

### Example of Calling the CreateApplication Method (a WRITE Trigger)

    box transparent Public
    Actor usr as lp-admin-user
    Participant Browser
    end
    box transparent Application Orchestrator
    Participant Gateway as API Gateway
    Participant IDP as Idntity Provider
    participant REST as REST Proxy
    participant Interceptor as gRPC Interceptor
    participant GRPC as gRPC Server
    participant OPA
    participant DB
    end
    usr ->> Browser: Create Publisher
    Browser->>Gateway: POST /catalog/publisher
    Gateway-->>Browser: redirect keycloak/authenticate
    Browser->>IDP: get /authenticate
    IDP-->>Browser: redirect gateway.intel.com/app/orch + id-token
    Browser->>Gateway: POST /catalog/publisher with id-token
    Gateway->> REST: POST /catalog/publisher with id-token
    REST->>Interceptor: CreateApplication
    Interceptor-->>IDP: Get JWKS keys and cache
    Interceptor->>Interceptor: Verify JWT Token
    Interceptor->>Interceptor: Extract JWT claims as gRPC metadata
    Interceptor->>GRPC: CreateApplication request with metadata
    GRPC->>OPA: POST /v1/data/catalogv3/CreateApplicationRequest with metadata and gRPC CreateApplicationRequest serialized to JSON
    OPA->>OPA: Execute "CreateApplicationResuest" REGO Rule
    OPA->>OPA: Compare roles of user (from metadata) to "allowed roles"
    OPA-->>GRPC: return {result: true} if allowed
    GRPC->>GRPC: check all other constraints
    GRPC->>DB: SQL INSERT to database
    DB-->>GRPC: Updated value
    GRPC-->>REST: Updated value as CreateApplicationResponse
    REST-->>Gateway: POST response body
    Gateway-->>Browser: return Web application
```

### Example of CreateApplication Through CLI

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    box transparent Public
    Actor usr as lp-admin-user
    Participant CLI
    end
    box transparent Application Orchestrator
    Participant Gateway as API Gateway
    Participant IDP as Idntity Provider
    participant REST as REST Proxy
    participant Interceptor as gRPC Interceptor
    participant GRPC as gRPC Server
    participant OPA
    participant DB
    end
    usr ->> CLI: Create Application
    CLI-->>usr: Please login
    usr->>CLI: login
    CLI->>IDP: POST keycloak/openid-connect/token
    IDP-->>CLI: return id-token
    CLI->>CLI: store token locally
    CLI-->usr: Logged in
    usr ->> CLI: Create Application with token
    CLI->>Gateway: POST /catalog/application with id-token
    Gateway->> REST: continuing as with browser scenario above
```

## REGO Rules (Policies)

The REGO rules (policies) are present [in the Helm chart](../deployments/app-orch-catalog/files/openpolicyagent), and
are loaded into a config map in OPA at startup. The OPA API `/v1/policy` can be used to update or inspect these at runtime.

### Test Rules Locally

> The [testdata](../deployments/app-orch-catalog/files/openpolicyagent/testdata) folder shows an example of the kind
> of input expected as a combination of `request` and `metadata`.

Test with:

```shell
opa eval -f pretty -b ~/intel/app-orch-catalog/deployments/application-catalog/files/openpolicyagent \
  --input ~/intel/app-orch-catalog/deployments/application-catalog/files/openpolicyagent/testdata/CreateApplicationInput.json \
  data.catalogv3.CreateApplicationRequest
```

> Note: Many IDEs support running these tests in a graphical environment, e.g., GoLand or IntelliJ IDEA.
