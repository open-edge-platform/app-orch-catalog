description: A Helm chart for Edge Orchestrator's Application Catalog.
# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into
#  versioned archives to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer.
# They're included as a dependency of application charts to inject those
# utilities and functions into the rendering pipeline. Library charts do not
# define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application
# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each
# time you make changes to the chart and its templates, including the app
# version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.11.22
# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version
# number should be incremented each time you make changes to the application.
# Versions are not expected to follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect
# the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
#
# appVersion is populated by invoking command: make chart
